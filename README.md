# Odin-Recursion

## Project tasks.

### Assignment 1.
- [x] Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
- [x] Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

### Assignment 2.
- [x] Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
